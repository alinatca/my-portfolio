## My Portfolio

# Description

A portfolio is crucial for front-end web developers because it helps show a small part of their skills. Since a web developer's main job is creating websites and applications, an online portfolio will help showcase your technical skills and attract potential clients.


# Challenges

Working on my portfolio was definitely a big challenge and it still is.

Using flex, grid and creating my first responsive website was really a challenge, there is a lot of information and deciding what to use and what works best with my creativity, was really something I had to think about.

I have chosen to use both flex and grid, as flex helps a lot in responsive and gird is very easy to understand, by combining the two I've managed to replicate the website given.

I have tried to keep the same layout, design and functionality. Preview the website below: ![website-layout](https://github.com/alinatca/my-portfolio/blob/2f33777447a0f3553aa1c3d2fd5c4b435cc9921f/website-preview-dekstop.png)


# Things I learned

I have developed my grid and flex skills, learned how responsiveness works and put together a fantastic website so far.
